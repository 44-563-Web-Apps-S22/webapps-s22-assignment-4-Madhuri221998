            <p> ELI. Here comes my father.<br>

                HAR. The carriage is quite ready, and you can start when you like.<br>
                CLE. Since you are not going, father, allow me to take care of them.<br>
                
                HAR. No, stop here; they can easily take care of themselves, and I
                want you.<br>
                
                
                SCENE III.--HARPAGON, CLÃ‰ANTE.<br>
                
                HAR. Well, now, all consideration of stepmother aside, tell me what do
                you think of this lady?<br>
                
                CLE. What I think of her?<br>
                
                HAR. Yes, what do you think of her appearance, her figure, her beauty
                and intelligence?<br>
                
                CLE. So, so.<br>
                
                HAR. But still?<br>

                CLE. To tell you the truth, I did not find her such as I expected. Her
                manner is that of a thorough coquette, her figure is rather awkward,
                her beauty very middling, and her intelligence of the meanest order.
                Do not suppose that I say this to make you dislike her; for if I must
                have a stepmother, I like the idea of this one as well as of any
                other.<br>

                HAR. You spoke to her just now, nevertheless....
